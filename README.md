RockIt Work

<h3>Elisa Bennett</h3>

A little bit about me...I’ve lived in Arizona since 1990.  When I was younger, I used to say I would marry a chef one day because I love food.  Luckily I have some food allergies so I can’t eat it all.  I’ve been married to Jeff for two years (not a chef but brings home the bacon).  I have two awesome kids, William (16), Melanie (13) and a beautiful step-daughter Alex (20), and lots…lots of cousins.

Jeff enjoys going to concerts, grew up in New England and has wonderful parents (it’s so awesome to have parents –in-law).  We met on ChristianMingle.com (I know!).  Alex is going to UofA.  William likes video games, motocross, and drawing.  Melanie is my energetic social butterfly.  

After growing up in Mexico, I’m very grateful to be living in the USA and for the right to bear arms.  I’m very family oriented and a mama-bear.   I like action movies, shooting guns, learning new things, arts and crafts, Hello Kitty, and most of all, spending time with my family. 

I am doing this pre-work to get accepted into <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fphxrockit.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFiuL4xZ3KqmYYLmPDvt85CFvnBEg"> RockIt Bootcamp</a.>
